# Swift Argument Label Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift caused by neglecting argument labels when calling functions.

The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect usage of the `calculateArea` function.  The correct usage, along with the error produced when omitting the label, is also demonstrated.

The `bugSolution.swift` file shows how to correct the issue by explicitly providing argument labels during the function call.

This example highlights the importance of paying close attention to Swift's parameter labels when writing and calling functions.
